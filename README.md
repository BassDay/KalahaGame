Kalaha game.
Client-server application done with Jetty Web Server & Jetty WebSockets API.

How to launch:
- "mvn clean install jetty:run" for building the app & launching the server.

To improve:
- provide configuration of the board layout at the beginning of the game.
- game room management (currently the app is limited to 2 players max).
- better UI.
